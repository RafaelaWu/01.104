## Introduction

Welcome to the NETFIX, a recommendation system powered by Restricted Bolztmann Machines. This library is designed as part of the course project in 01.104 The Networked Life at SUTD, taught by Prof. Costas Courcobetis. 

## Installation

To install the library, simply clone the Github repository and install the requisite libraries as follows:

```pip install numpy```

```pip install matplotlib```

That's it! Now you can run any of the example notebooks or scripts, or even use our libraries to design your own recommendation engines. Have fun!

## Modules

The library modules are housed in the `Scripts` folder. In particular, this folder contains several files as explained below:

1. projectLib.py
2. linearRegression.py
3. rbm.py

## Project Submissions and Results

As part of the project requirements, we implemented various additional methods (as detailed above) to improve the accuracy of our predictions.
